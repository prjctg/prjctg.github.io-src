# Developer Guide

Welcome, Developers! This guide will help you dive into the technical side of Anı⃰mr by contributing code for animations, games, and more.

### What you can do as a Developer:

- **Create custom animations and games**: Sync your creations with music using the event-based system.
- **Interact with song data**: Programmatically control music (play, pause, seek) and retrieve song metadata within your code.
- **Use the API**: Access a rich set of methods, constants, and event types to build dynamic experiences.
- **Feature highlights**:
  - Autocompletion in the code editor
  - Example event-based code snippets to get started

### How to Get Started:

1. Familiarize yourself with the API and available music control methods.
2. Write your first animation or game using the event-based system.
3. Test and submit your code through the platform.

Refer to the [Full Developer Documentation](../developer/full-docs) for detailed API references, tutorials, and sample code.
